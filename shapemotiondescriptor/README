***********************************
1) Toolboxes
The package uses the Piotr's matlab toolbox (http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/)
and optical flow toolbox (http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ogale/openvis3d/docs/index.html)
Both of them are provided in this package, you might need to recompile these two toolbox,  

please run the matlab file

"toolbox\external\toolboxCompile.m " 

and run the command within matlab 

"mex OvFlowMatlab.cpp MatlabImageAdapter.cpp OvImageAdapter.cpp"

2) How to use the feature extraction code for shape-motion descriptor

About how to extract shape and motion descriptor, please refer to the matlab file 
'demo_code.m'. The detailed explanations for parameters have been provided in this file. You can run 
it to further understand our approach.


If you happen to use this feature extraction code, please cite one of our papers:

This feature extraction package is successfully tested on Windows7 64 bits, Windows XP 32 bits 
and Matlab R2009b, R2007b.
